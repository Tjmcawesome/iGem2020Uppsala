##Introduction##
  Here the GROMACS turtorial for simulating a molecular dynamic (MD) system containing protein in water with ions will be briefly explained with adaptions to our project of analyzing nanobodies.
  Link to full tutorial:
    http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/lysozyme/index.html

##Materials##
 *pdb protein file
    We are using the .pdb files of our nanobodies from primarly swissprot
    Here refered to as "filename"
 *Uppmax account
    hereafter when writning "username" it will refere to your uppmax username since we are working in uppmax all the time.
 *GROMACS
 *Github - iGem2020Uppsala/batch_scripts/prot_water

##Procedure##
#Start-up: Log in to Uppmax and create workspace
1. Entering the following command with your username in terminal: ssh username@rackham.uppmax.uu.se
2. Thereafter enter your uppmax password
3. Make a directory to have as a workspace during the tutorial
    command to create a directory: mkdir dir_name
    *dir_name exemple: GROMACS

#Step One: Prepare topology
4. Activate GROMACS useing the following command: "module load gromacs" or "ml gromacs"
5. Download a pdb file of the protein you want to target
    *Use pdb from swissprot
6. Delete water molecues ("HOH") in your file
    *Our nanobody pdb shouldn't have crystal waters but it is still good to do 6.1
    6.1 Take a look at it in some vizualizationprogram (VMD, Chimera, Pymol etc.)
    6.2 Delete water molecules with the following command:
    grep -v HOH filname.pdb > filname_clean.pdb
7. Create gmx-file from pdb-file (pdb2gmx)
    7.1. Execute: gmx pdb2gmx -f filename_clean.pdb -o filename_processed.gro -water spce
    7.2. Choose force field 15 (type 15 at command promt and press enter)
    *Three files should be now in the "GROMACS" directory: filename_processed.gro, topol.top, and posre.itp (Check by typing "ls" in command promt)
    *"posre.itp" will be used for step six (equilibration)

#Step Two: Examine the topology
8. OPTIONAL (to know more about the toplogy-files) : Read throuh step two in the GROMACS tutorial linked in the begining of this protocol./

#Step Three: Define box and solvate
9. Define the dimentions of the box with the following edit configuration command:
    gmx editconf -f filename_processed.gro -o filename_newbox.gro -c -d 1.0 -bt cubic
    "-c" = centers the protein in the box, "-d 1.0" = distance from the protein to the edge of the box is 1.0 nm, "-bt cubic" = defines box as a cube
10. Next command will fill the box with solvent (in our case water):
    gmx solvate -cp filename_newbox.gro -cs spc216.gro -o filename_solv.gro -p topol.top
    "-cp" = configuration of protein and is contained in the output of step 8, "-cs" = configuration of solvent and is part of GROMACS standard, "-o" = output and is in this case filename_solv.gro which changes the topology file "topol.top"

#Step Four: Adding ions
    *Tool to add ions is called genion - it needs a ".tpr" file as input
    *To make the ".tpr" file a ".mdp" file needs to go through a grompp command
    *Make sure you have activatade gromacs with ml gromacs!
11. Create a .mdp file by copypasting a script from github (the scripts in github will be used throughout the entire tutorial)
  11. 1 write in command promt: nano ion.mdp
  11. 2 copy the content from github: iGem2020Uppsala/batch_scripts/prot_water/ions.mdp and paste it in the new file (press control+shift+v to paste in commandline)
  11. 3 press ^X, then Y, then enter to save the changes in the file
12. Create a .tpr file by using the grompp - command as follows:
    gmx grompp -f ions.mdp -c filename_solv.gro -p topol.top -o ions.tpr
13. Check with the command "ls" if the "ion.tpr" has been created in your working directory.
14. Thereafter use the genion command:
    gmx genion -s ions.tpr -o filename_solv_ions.gro -p topol.top -pname NA -nname CL -neutral
    Then enter 13 ("SOL")
    *For more info about genion read through step four in the tutorial.

#Step Five: Energy Minimization
  *once agin a ".mdp" file (found in github: iGem2020Uppsala/batch_scripts/prot_water/minim.mdp) will be grompped to make a ".tpr" file (em.tpr)
  *the "em.tpr" file will be used for the energy minimization which will through sbatch be carried out on Uppmax supercomputer.
15. Create the minim.mdp by following the same steps as in step 11.
16. Make a sbatch job with the script mdrun_emin.sh found in github
    16.1. write in command promt: nano mdrun_emin.
    16.2. copypaste the mdrun_emin.sh file found in github (iGem2020Uppsala/batch_scripts/prot_water/mdrun_emin.sh)
    16.3. change "youraccount" after -A on line 3 to "g2020015"
    16.4. also change "YOURJOBNAME" (line 5) to initials_nanobody_eq  (e.g. MP_A44_emin)
    16.5. change the cores: first line 12 after "-n" write 10 instead of 20, then in line 22 after "-nt" also write 10 instead of 20
    16.6. to save and exit: press ^X, then Y, then enter
    16.7. run the file by the following command: sbatch mdrun_emin.sh
    *Double check if the job is in the queue: squeue -u username
    *Check status of job by entering: jobinfo usernameld
    *the run should be finished in about 1 hours
17. When the job is done the following files should be listed (check with ls-command in working direktory):
    em.log: ASCII-text log file of the EM process
    em.edr: Binary energy file
    em.trr: Binary full-precision trajectory
    em.gro: Energy-minimized structure
18. Analyse the potential energy
    Type: gmx energy -f em.edr -o potential.xvg
    then "10 0" to select the potential option

#Step Six and Seven: Equilibration
  *First the temperature is stabilazed by steps 14-16 when creating the nvt.tpr file
  *Then the preassure is stabilized through the 17 which is done same as 14-16 but other files.
19. Create an nvt.mdp file (script is found in github) in workspace
  *This is done to stablaize the temperature
    19.1. write in command promt: nano nvt.mdp
    19.2. copypaste the nvt.mdp file found in github (iGem2020Uppsala/batch_scripts/prot_water/nvt.mdp)
    19.3. press ^X, then Y, then enter to save the changes in the file
20. Make a sbatch job as in step five (without changing cores!) with the script mdrun_eq.sh found in github
    20.1. write in command promt: nano mdrun_eq.sh
    20.2. copypaste the mdrun_eq.sh file found in github (iGem2020Uppsala/batch_scripts/prot_water/mdrun_eq.sh)
    20.3. change "youraccount" after -A on line 3 to "g2020015"
    20.4. also change "YOURJOBNAME" (line 5) to initials_nanobody_eq  (e.g. MP_A44_eq)
    20.5. to save and exit: press ^X, then Y, then enter
    20.6. run the file by the following command: sbatch mdrun_eq.sh
    *Double check if the job is in the queue: squeue -u username
    *Check status of job by entering: jobinfo usernameld
    *the run should be finished in about 2 hours
21. When the job is finsished a new outputfile nvt.tpr is created.
22. Do the same as for the nvt.mdp file but for the npt.mdp file found in github (iGem2020Uppsala/batch_scripts/prot_water/npt.mdp)
23. The batch sripct used is also found in github (iGem2020Uppsala/batch_scripts/prot_water/mdrun_eq2.sh)
