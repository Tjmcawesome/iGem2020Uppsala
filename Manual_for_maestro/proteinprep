##Introduction##
  This is the procedure we will use to prepare a protein file for use in other programs

##Materials##
#maestro
 *your protein file
 *hsp16_min.pdb

##Procedure##
#Maestro Protein Preparation Wizard
1. Import your structure to maestro using ctr-I or File>Import structures.
2. Open the protein preparation wizard from the tasks button in the top right, or in the toolbar above the workspace navigator
3. In the Import and Preprocess tab leave all defaults and click preprocess, once your protein - preprocessed appears in the entry list continue
4. In the refine tab, leave defaults, and click optimize, wait for it to incorporate as your protein - hbond-opt (complete and get added to the entry list)
5. Once optimized click remove waters
6. Once your protein - removed waters appears, click minimize, this step will take a few minutes.
7. Export your protein using File>Export structures
8. Name your file your protein min with no spaces
9. Change extension to .pdb and click save
